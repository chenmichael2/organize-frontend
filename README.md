# Future Direction

Some implementations that would be added in the future include:

- Providing a faster and easier way to delete and edit projects and tasks
- Provide a better format for the task buttons (specifically the done or in works button).
- Side bar to be formatted better and allow user to click it and it will show the project that is selected
- A better way to organize the tasks and allow movement of those tasks
